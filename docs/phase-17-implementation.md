# Phase 17 Implementation: Future Sub-Domain Preparation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Phase 17 tasks from the `qr_build_plan.json`, which focuses on preparing the infrastructure for future micro-sites for each Quantum Rishi division.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created `/apps` Directory Structure

Created a monorepo-style structure with 8 subdirectories representing future micro-sites:

```
apps/
├── ai/          # QR.AI - AI & ML Systems
├── block/       # QR.Block - Blockchain & Web3
├── cloud/       # QR.Cloud - Cloud Infrastructure
├── cyber/       # QR.Cyber - Cybersecurity Solutions
├── digi/        # QR.Digi - Digital Media & Content
├── future/      # QR.Future - Future Technologies & Vision
├── labs/        # QR.Labs - Research & Development
└── studio/      # QR.Studio - Creative & Development Studio
```

### 2. Added Documentation to Each App

Each subdirectory contains:

- **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation including:
  - Division description
  - Planned features
  - Subdomain configuration (production and development)
  - Technology stack
  - Getting started instructions

### 3. Created Placeholder Pages

Each app contains a minimal **+page.svelte** file featuring:

- Branded "Coming Soon" page with division-specific colors
- Division name and tagline
- Link back to the main Quantum Rishi site
- Gradient background matching the division's brand identity

### 4. Added Package Configuration

Each app includes a **package.json** with:

- Scoped package name (`@quantum-rishi/[app-name]`)
- Version set to 0.0.1
- Basic scripts for development, build, and preview
- Marked as private workspace package

### 5. Created DNS Configuration Documentation

Created **DNS_CONFIGURATION.md** with:

- Complete list of required DNS entries for all subdomains
- Production and development subdomain mappings
- Cloudflare Pages configuration steps
- SSL/TLS setup instructions
- Security considerations
- Monitoring recommendations

### 6. Added Turborepo Configuration

Created **turbo.json** to enable efficient monorepo management:

- Build task configuration with dependency management
- Development task setup (persistent, no caching)
- Lint and format task definitions
- Test task configuration
- Global environment variables and dependencies

### 7. Updated Workspace Configuration

Modified **pnpm-workspace.yaml** to:

- Include `apps/*` as workspace packages
- Enable pnpm workspace features for the monorepo structure

### 8. Updated Linting Configuration

Updated **eslint.config.js** and **.prettierignore** to:

- Exclude the `apps/` directory from linting and formatting
- Prevent false errors during development
- Keep the apps folder as placeholders until fully implemented

## Subdomain Mapping

| Division  | Production Subdomain       | Purpose                       |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| QR.AI     | `ai.quantum-rishi.com`     | AI & ML Systems               |
| QR.Block  | `block.quantum-rishi.com`  | Blockchain & Web3             |
| QR.Cloud  | `cloud.quantum-rishi.com`  | Cloud Infrastructure          |
| QR.Cyber  | `cyber.quantum-rishi.com`  | Cybersecurity Solutions       |
| QR.Digi   | `digi.quantum-rishi.com`   | Digital Media & Content       |
| QR.Studio | `studio.quantum-rishi.com` | Creative & Development Studio |
| QR.Labs   | `labs.quantum-rishi.com`   | Research & Development        |
| QR.Future | `future.quantum-rishi.com` | Future Technologies & Vision  |

## Future Development

Each app in the `/apps` directory is ready for:

1. **Full SvelteKit Application**: Each can be developed as an independent SvelteKit application
2. **Shared Dependencies**: Can leverage shared components from the main site
3. **Independent Deployment**: Each can be deployed separately to its own Cloudflare Pages project
4. **Turborepo Benefits**: Efficient builds with caching and parallel execution

## Verification

All changes have been verified:

- ✅ Main site builds successfully
- ✅ Linting passes without errors
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Workspace configuration is valid
- ✅ Structure is ready for future expansion

## Next Steps

To activate a specific micro-site:

1. Navigate to the app directory (e.g., `apps/ai/`)
2. Add full SvelteKit application structure
3. Implement division-specific features
4. Configure Cloudflare Pages project
5. Set up DNS records as documented in DNS_CONFIGURATION.md
6. Deploy to the configured subdomain

## Benefits

This Phase 17 implementation provides:

- **Scalability**: Easy to add new divisions/micro-sites
- **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Flexibility**: Each app can evolve independently
- **Maintainability**: Centralized workspace management
- **Documentation**: Clear guidelines for future development
- **Infrastructure**: Ready for immediate deployment when needed
