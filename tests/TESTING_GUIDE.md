**Phase 15 Requirement**: ✅ Console errors detected and validated

## Performance Targets

Based on Phase 15 requirements and industry best practices:

| Metric                 | Target  | Tested In                |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| Animation Frame Rate   | 60 FPS  | `performance.spec.ts`    |
| Page Load Time         | < 3s    | `performance.spec.ts`    |
| First Contentful Paint | < 1.5s  | `performance.spec.ts`    |
| JavaScript Execution   | < 2s    | `performance.spec.ts`    |
| Layout Duration        | < 500ms | `performance.spec.ts`    |
| Page Transitions       | < 2s    | `performance.spec.ts`    |
| Console Errors         | 0       | `console-errors.spec.ts` |
| Touch Target Size      | ≥ 44px  | `responsive.spec.ts`     |
| Minimum Font Size      | ≥ 14px  | `responsive.spec.ts`     |

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are automatically run on:

- Push to `main`, `dev`, or `copilot/**` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `dev` branches

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Location: `.github/workflows/test.yml`

The workflow:

1. Sets up Node.js 20
2. Installs pnpm and dependencies
3. Installs Playwright browsers with system dependencies
4. Runs all Playwright tests
5. Uploads test reports and screenshots (on failure)

### Viewing CI Test Results

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in GitHub
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. View test results in the "Playwright Tests" job
4. Download artifacts (reports, screenshots) if tests fail

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Installation Issues

If you encounter issues installing browsers:

```bash
# Clear Playwright cache
rm -rf ~/.cache/ms-playwright

# Reinstall browsers
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps chromium

# Skip browser download (for CI/CD)
PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 pnpm install
```

### Tests Timing Out

If tests timeout:

1. Check if the preview server is running
2. Increase timeout in test: `test.setTimeout(60000)`
3. Check network connectivity

### Flaky Tests

If tests are inconsistent:

1. Add proper waits: `await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')`
2. Use explicit assertions with timeouts
3. Check for race conditions in animations

### Tests Fail in CI but Pass Locally

Common causes:

1. Missing system dependencies (use `--with-deps`)
2. Different screen sizes
3. CI runs in headless mode (use `--headed` locally to debug)

## Known Console Messages

The following console messages are intentional and not errors:

1. **HeroSection.svelte** (line 231):

   ```javascript
   console.log('Launch QR Studio - Coming soon!');
   ```

   - Purpose: Placeholder for future QR Studio navigation
   - Type: Debug log (not an error)
   - Action: Intentional, will be removed when QR Studio is implemented

2. **smoothScroll.ts** (line 21):

   ```javascript
   console.warn(`Element with ID "${elementId}" not found`);
   ```

   - Purpose: Developer warning for missing scroll targets
   - Type: Warning (not an error)
   - Action: Intentional error handling, helps developers debug

## Writing New Tests

When adding new features, add corresponding tests:

### Test Structure Template

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
	test('should perform specific action', async ({ page }) => {
		// 1. Navigate
		await page.goto('/your-route');

		// 2. Interact
		await page.click('button');

		// 3. Assert
		await expect(page.locator('.result')).toBeVisible();
	});
});
```

### Best Practices

1. Use descriptive test names
2. Group related tests with `test.describe()`
3. Keep tests independent
4. Use data-testid for stable selectors
5. Add proper waits for async operations
6. Test user workflows, not implementation
7. Add comments for complex scenarios

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- [ ] Update Playwright monthly: `pnpm update @playwright/test`
- [ ] Review and update browser versions
- [ ] Check for deprecated APIs
- [ ] Review test coverage as features are added
- [ ] Update performance baselines as needed

### When Adding New Features

- [ ] Add routing tests if new routes
- [ ] Add responsive tests if UI changes
- [ ] Add performance tests if animations
- [ ] Update console error tests if new logs
