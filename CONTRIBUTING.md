### PR Review Process

- All PRs require at least one approval from a maintainer
- Address review feedback promptly
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Ensure CI checks pass

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid `any` types - use proper type definitions
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Export types that might be reused

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Use proper prop types/interfaces
- Follow React best practices
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful component and prop names

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow existing design patterns
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
- Maintain accessibility (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

### File Organization

- Place components in `/components` directory
- UI primitives go in `/components/ui`
- Utilities go in `/lib` directory
- Follow existing naming conventions

### Code Quality

- Write clean, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Remove console.logs before committing (unless necessary)
- Handle errors gracefully
- Consider performance implications

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Follow existing test patterns

## Commit Message Guidelines
